# 💫 About Me:
I enjoy working with C++, SQL, Python, and Java, leveraging these technologies to solve real-world problems with clean and efficient solutions. I’m a lifelong learner, currently exploring topics in Software design, data analysis, and database. I believe in the power of teamwork and the open-source community, continuously striving to share knowledge and contribute meaningful code. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me immersed in problem-solving exercises, exploring new concepts, or refining my software designs to meet clear and precise specifications
